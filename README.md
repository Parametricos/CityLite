## About

CityLite is a smart cities concept platform for smarter and greener cities. It was initially designed and developed in under 48 hours as part of our submission for the [Cassini Hackathon](https://hackathons.cassini.eu/) - Digitising Green Spaces in June 2021.

The fast-paced work environment of the construction industry along with the lack of data during a project, forces most construction professionals to construct a project in a very short timeline. This practice emerges in isolation, with minimum consideration of the surrounding environment and the community the project will be in. CityLite is an open-source, smart cities platform for professionals in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC), that empowers their workflow in all phases of a project cycle.

CityLite is a centralised platform for gathering data from different sources such as satellites, 3D Building Information Modeling models (BIM), GIS and IoT devices for the user to simulate different urban scenarios for a better built environment.

#### CityLite is based on open-source software such as [harpgl](https://www.harp.gl/), [ifcjs](https://agviegas.github.io/ifcjs-docs/#/) and [threejs](https://threejs.org/) and others

### Note: This software is experimental (WIP)

## Demo

Try CityLite [here!](https://parametricos-cassini-hackathon.vercel.app)

## Getting Started (with Demo)
There are three main actions on the CityLite demo at the moment: 
1. Load a BIM model on the map by uploading your own IFC file and geolocate it with coordinates
2. Upload a GIS (GeoJson) source and create a layer to visualise it
3. Simulate the sun and shadows by selecting the calendar on the top right

## Contribution
There's a few ways to contribute to this project and improve it:
1. Fork the project repository and make your first pull request
2. Submit sample Satelite Images (TIF), BIM Models (IFC), a square thumbnail image and the project's location
3. Test it and create Issues in github so that we can start working on them

## Using the library

## Developed
CityLite was part of a submission to [Cassini Hackathon](https://hackathons.cassini.eu/) in 2021. CityLite is developed and maintained by [Parametricos Ltd.](https://parametricos.com "Parametricos Ltd."). CityLite and was open sourced in the name of BIM, GIS and it's community! On the 26th of May 2021 we open sourced our first package BCF-js which was part of the Studio 3DX.
