## About

CityLite is a smart cities concept platform for smarter and greener cities. It was initially designed and developed in under 48 hours as part of our submission for the [Cassini Hackathon](https://hackathons.cassini.eu/) - Digitising Green Spaces in June 2021.

The fast-paced work environment of the construction industry along with the lack of data during a project, forces most construction professionals to construct a project in a very short timeline. This practice emerges in isolation, with minimum consideration of the surrounding environment and the community the project will be in. CityLite is an open-source, smart cities platform for professionals in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC), that empowers their workflow in all phases of a project cycle.

CityLite is a centralised platform for gathering data from different sources such as satellites, 3D Building Information Modeling models (BIM), GIS and IoT devices for the user to simulate different urban scenarios for a better built environment.

#### CityLite is based on open-source software such as [harpgl](https://www.harp.gl/), [ifcjs](https://agviegas.github.io/ifcjs-docs/#/) and [threejs](https://threejs.org/) and others

### Note: This software is experimental (WIP)
